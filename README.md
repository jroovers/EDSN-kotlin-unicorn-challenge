# Da Unicorn Challenge!
Find and solve as many TODOs as possible.

Hint: find an associated unit test for each TODO to test your solution.
Exception is coroutines challenge which does not have a unit test but uses main + println to help understand how coroutines work.
Please do exercises in the following order:
1. Start with `basics` package
2. Then do `extensions` package
3. After that `functional` package
4. Finally `coroutines` package
